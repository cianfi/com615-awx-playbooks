# Introduction
This is the git repository for COM615, where AWX is used for network automation. This repository contains the neccessary playbooks / code needed for the requirements that were created for my related case study. 

This is currently a WIP

Current playbook process:
1) dev_playbooks
2) test_playbooks
3) production_playbooks

NOTES:
- can use netconf / other types of transport for connection.
- different ways to collect hostnames and passwords.
