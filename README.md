# Introduction
This is the git repository for COM615, where AWX is used for network automation. This repository contains the neccessary playbooks / code needed for the requirements that were created for my related case study. 

This is currently a WIP

## Current playbook process:
1) dev_playbooks - all ideas of playbooks will be here. 
2) test_playbooks - once playbooks is created, moved to here and tested.
3) production_playbooks - once tested and complete, moved to here and used in production. 

## Secrets
If you want to pull this repo and test it, 'alert.yml' requires two variables which is pulled from 'secret.yml' within 'production_playbooks/' directory.
